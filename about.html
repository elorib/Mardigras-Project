              <u>General Information about the Holiday of Mardi Gras</u>
            </p>
            <p class="mardigras-info">
              The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana,
              including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated
              for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day
              before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
              tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
              permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
              most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
              Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
              Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
              (some of them masquerade balls). The parades in New Orleans are
              organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
              parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established
              krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
              Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super
              krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events, such
              as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming
              celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of
              Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings),
              as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Clubâ€”a predominantly
              African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws
              into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful
              plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon
              Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same
              parade schedule and route each year. While many tourists center
              their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
              originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route
              along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
              the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du
              Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg
              Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras
              day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of
              the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

              <u>The History of the Holiday of Mardi Gras</u>
            </p>
            <p class="mardigras-info">
              The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was
              at the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower
              Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville,
              Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of
              Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the
              festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by
              Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and
              costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man -
              The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls
              was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the
              streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited
              by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were
              lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de
              Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised
              money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.
              <br /><br />
              Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New
              Orleans, for that is the day for fun, frolic, and comic
              masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide
              awake in active operation. Men and boys, women and girls, bond and
              free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to
              invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible,
              strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of
              beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts,
              demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats
              from the moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers
              parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches,
              cars, &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly
              shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all
              throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

        <div class="background-information">
          <article>
            <p class="mardigras-info">
              <u>LaToya Cantrell</u>
            </p>
            <p class="mardigras-info">
              LaToya Cantrell (nÃ©e Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
              politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana since
              May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the
              office. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on
              the New Orleans City Council from 2012â€“2018.
              <br /><br />
              Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to
              New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier University of Louisiana,
              where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive
              training program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
              <br /><br />In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New
              Orleans City Council seat vacated when former District B
              representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position.
              After the November election, candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell
              advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent
              of the vote. Cantrell served out the balance of Head's term, and
              was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014. As a council
              member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice
              issues. She introduced a bill banning smoking at restaurants and
              bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand
              smoke on service industry workers. The council unanimously passed
              the bill in 2015. Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a
              low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was objected to by
              residents because of its proposed placement in Central City, New
              Orleans. Instead, the shelter was moved to the downtown site of
              the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation
              with at-large council member Jason Williams to register and
              inspect rental units in the city. As a member of the Criminal
              Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install
              crime cameras in her district, assess the effectiveness of
              citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address understaffing at
              the New Orleans Police Department.
